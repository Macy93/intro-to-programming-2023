            <h1>About</h1>
            <p>I am currently a student at Code the Dream where beginning programmers are taught skills to build apps.
                Concurrently, I work at Amazon as a Problem Solver in the stow area. Previously, I was a Sales Associate
                in
                the jewelry, shoe, apparel, and accessory departments at Walmart. While working for Walmart, I earned a
                Web
                Design and Application Certificate through Wilmington University in Delaware. For fun, I enjoy spending
                my
                free time with family and friends.</p>
